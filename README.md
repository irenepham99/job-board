# HackerNews Jobs Plus

HackerNew's Job board is great, but trying to browse through the list of jobs can be a bit challenging and overwhelming based on the way its formatted. This application is meant to help job seekers browse through HackerNew's Job in a more enjoyable way and save jobs that they're interested in. 

All data is taken from https://news.ycombinator.com/jobs. 

*This is a serverless application so user data is saved on a per session basis.
